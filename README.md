Who among your Twitter followers can invite you to [Lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs)? Use this lobsterita to discover.

---

[Lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs) is a link sharing and commenting network, similar to Hackernews. But before you can use lobste.rs, you need to get an invite from an existing community member.

Because scrolling through ~15K people is not good for your mental health, I created this script.

### Prerequisites

* This script requires Node 10+

* Because the script uses Twitter API, you'll need to provide your [Twitter developer account](https://developer.twitter.com) credentials.

### Using the script

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# run the script
$ node index
```

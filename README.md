Who among your Twitter followers can invite you to [Lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs)? Use this tool to discover.

---

[Lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs) is a link sharing and commenting network, similar to Hackernews. But before you can use [lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs), you need to get an invite from an existing community member.

Because scrolling through ~15K people is not good for your mental health, I created this script.

### Prerequisites

* This script requires Node 10+

* Because the script uses Twitter API, you'll need to provide your [Twitter developer account](https://developer.twitter.com) credentials.

### Using the script

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# run the script
$ node index
```

The script will tell you a list of your followers who can invite you to [lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs).

### Ask for invite

> Hi **name**, I noticed you're a member of invite-only lobste.rs. Could you please send me an invite to **email**? Thanks!

### Now you're a lobster
